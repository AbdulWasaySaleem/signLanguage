mediapipe==0.9.0.1
scikit-learn==1.2.0
numpy 

Starting with the collecting image making a subcategory for each images(data)
creating a dataset(in dictionary) in order to make a classifier (it will create sign_language_dataset.picle file) 
training a classifier with RandomForstClassifier (it will create trained_model.picle with the help of above)
inference the classifier final file
